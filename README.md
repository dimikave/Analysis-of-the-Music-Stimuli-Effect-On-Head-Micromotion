**Abstract:** This paper is a comprehensive study on classification of motion capture data based on features extracted from wavelet analysis (using Discrete Wavelet Transform), Higher-Order Spectral  Analysis  (HOSA)  and  Cepstral  Analysis.  More  specifically, the  analysis  presented  is  a  continuation  of  the  open  researchon  the  influence  of  auditory  stimuli  on  human  micromotion, following  the  MICRO  project  of  the  RITMO  Centre  of  the University of Oslo. The idea of the classification is to confirm that this micromotion is affected by the music genre, using new approaches on the specific problem. The emphasis on this paper is  given  more  to  the  time-series  representing  the  motion  of  the head and not the direct correlation with the auditory stimuli, but rather  the  labels  of  each  of  the  music  genre.  From  the  analysis mentioned above, features were extracted and a classifier was used; HOS-Cepstrum Classifier. The results show that the best accuracy (holdout- 25%) the classifier  could  achieve  is  equal  to  64.81%.

## Status of the project
As of the completion of the project, it will probably be modified in case of more research in the field, but in any case it will not be maintained for now.
